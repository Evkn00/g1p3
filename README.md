AUDABC Group 1 Project 3 
Update 16/07/2023

Please note when marking:
- Load project in Google Chrome Incognito window.
- CORS errors due to local hosting have been diferent on all 3 of our machines, but as of now it is working on all 3 (2 windows, 1 mac). The IPYNB to create the mongo server functions slighty differently for each of us, hopefully it works, but it works for us now.


- app.py - Flask Server
- main.ipynb - Mongo db setup + flask setup
- logic.js - main js file including mapping and click monitoring
- style.css - main file styling
- data/TOPO_Shipwrecks_GDA2020.geojson - geojson data file. Unfortunately the datasource does not have a live version, so can only be downloaded as .zip.
- index.html - html file for display.
- Images folder - includes icons for map and background image.
- Superseeded folder - old version kept just in case.
